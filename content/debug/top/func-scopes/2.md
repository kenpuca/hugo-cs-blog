Dynamic variables are symbols that can be temporally
bound to a new value, and the binding propagates into
the body of a function.  This pattern is known as
_dynamic scopes_, and is generally considered as a
**bad idea**.  Nonetheless, here it is.

## Declaration of dynamic var

Dynamic vars are special symbols.  Unlike other symbols,
their bindings can be *changed* in the same scope.

{{<highlight clojure>}}
(def ^:dynamic tax-rate 0.1)
(defn calc-tax [income] (* tax-rate income))
{{</highlight>}}

The dynamic var acts as a normal symbol,
and is captured by the lexical rule.

{{<highlight clojure>}}
(calc-tax 1000) ; => 100.0
{{</highlight>}}

## Dynamic binding

But the existing binding of a dynamic var can be modified.

{{<highlight clojure>}}
(binding [tax-rate 0.15]
  (calc-tax 1000)) ;=> 150.0
{{</highlight>}}

This is something that `(let ...)` cannot achieve:

{{<highlight clojure>}}
(let [tax-rate 0.15]
  (calc-tax 1000)) ;=> 100.0
{{</highlight>}}
