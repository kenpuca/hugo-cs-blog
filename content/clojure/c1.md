Learning Clojure requires you to install Clojure.
Luckily, contrary to common belief, Clojure compiler
is as simple as a single file.

Let's see how we setup a running environment for Linux or macos.

## You need Java

You will need Java runtime.  I use Java 8 (in 2018) with my Clojure
installation. You only need the JRE.

```
$ sudo apt-get install openjdk-8-jre
```

## Download Clojure compiler

The Clojure compiler comes as a single `.jar` file.  How convenient.

Here is the URL.  Just download `clojure-1.8.0.jar` (~3.5M)

```
https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/org/clojure/clojure/1.8.0/
```

## Write Clojure and run

```
$ echo '(println "hello world")' > hello.clj
$ java -jar clojure-1.8.0.jar hello.clj
```

## REPL

```
$ java -jar clojure-1.8.0.jar
Clojure 1.8.0
user =>
```

## A little program

```
; a.clj
(let [name "Jack"]
  (println "Greetings" name))
```

Let's run it:

```
$ java -jar clojure-1.8.0.jar a.clj
```
