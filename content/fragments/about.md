I am a computer scientist. At the same time, I am also a professor at a
small university.

My job description is very open ended.  A large chunk of my time is spent
on the _education_ of computer science. Normally, I teach four undergraduate
courses on a variety of topics in computer science.  Given that my expertise
is in systems, my teaching is usually limited to systems courses such as
_Compilers_ and _Databases_.
