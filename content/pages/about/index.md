I am a professor in Computer Science at a Canadian
university.  My job description is very open ended. 

**Teaching**

> A large chunk of my time is spent
on the _education_ of computer science. Normally, I teach four undergraduate
courses on a variety of topics in computer science.  Given that my expertise
is in systems, my teaching is usually limited to systems courses such as
_Compilers_ and _Databases_.

**Research**

> I do research in database. I like how broad database can be, and it allows
me to work on a wide range of problems. I worked on projects ranging from
database on mobile devices to managing open data from different countries.
More recently, I am working on managing logical constraints using databases.

**This Blog**

> I don't like social media platforms (Twitter, Facebook, G+) because they don't
> support _scientific writing_ at all.  I think one day I might work on a social
> network for scientists.  Until then, I share my ideas here.

> Think of the writings here as my twitter feed.
